I am currently an M.S. student in Computer Science at Cornell University advised by Professor [Bharath Hariharan](http://home.bharathh.info) and [Madeleine Udell](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/mru8/). Previously, I received my B.S. from Cornell University with double majors in Computer Science and Operations Research.

My research interests lie in machine learning and computer vision, with the overarching goal to design machine learning systems that can automatically and continually learn about the surrounding world. Topics that I am interested in include continual learning, automated machine learning, domain generalization, etc.
